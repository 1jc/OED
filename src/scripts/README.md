## Database Migration Scripts Usage

The scripts ``` dumpDatabase.sh ``` and ``` restoreDatabase.sh ``` are meant to be used to migrate OED's Postgres version from 10.13 to 15.1. See [this guide](../../Documentation/Script%20Database%20Migration%20Steps) for usage.

If the scripts don't work, [this guide](../../Documentation/Manual%20Database%20Migration%20Steps) has manual steps to migrate the database.
