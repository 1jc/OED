# Automated pipeline testing files

See the original manual testing files for the script and README that gives more information on these tests.

**Note there are new tests in the manual file that are not in this file. They should be incorporated and the file names modified to fit this scheme.**

## Tests with one input file of readings

The input file will be pipe#Input.csv and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected.

| number | manual test ID | Descending time | Cumulative | Cumulative reset | Reading length variation | Reading gap | Duplication | End only | Description |

| 27     | pipe44         |                 |            |                  |                          |             |             |          | The second reading end time is invalid so errors on that one and no readings. |

Should get error for lines 2 & 4 and dropped. Length variation so no warnings about that. Only get readings 3 & 5. |

There is also a warning about reading #3 since reading #2 had a different length. Should see readings 3-5. |
| 33     | pipe50         |                 |     X      |                  |                          |             |             |          | The third reading has a negative value so all readings rejected. |

Also get gap warning on reading three since 2nd was wrong. Expect to have readings 1 & 3-5.|
| 35     | pipe52         |                 |            |                  |                          |             |             |  X       | The second reading has end time that is same as the first reading's end time and the reading is rejected. In end only data you use the previous to get the current start so the reading spans no time. Also get length warning on reading three since 2nd was wrong. Also get warning length on reading #4 since #3 was messed up. Expect to have readings 3-5. |

## Tests with one input file that is gzipped of readings

The input file will be pipe#Input.csv.gz and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected.

| number | manual test ID | Descending time | Cumulative | Cumulative reset | Reading length variation | Reading gap | Duplication | End only | Description |
| :----: | :----------:   | :-------------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :------: | :---------: |
| 40     | pipe20         |                 | X          |                  |                          |             |             |          | Check gzip (with header). Get standard cum values. |

## Tests with two input files of readings

The input neter file will be pipe#AInput.csv & pipe#BInput.csv and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected.

| number | manual test ID | Descending time | Cumulative | Cumulative reset | Reading length variation | Reading gap | Duplication | End only | Description |
| :----: | :----------:   | :-------------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :------: | :---------: |

Should get 0, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5.5, 6. |
| 51     | pipe39         |                 |            |                  |                          |             |             |          | Do second insert without update where change value 1 to 1.5 and 5 to 5.5 and insert new value 0 a day earlier and 6 a day later. The updates to 1.5 and 5.5 should not happen but new values should appear. Should get 0-6. |
| 52     | pipe24         |                 | X          | Default          |                          |             |             |          | Add two more values via second curl but this time the second one involves a reset. Expect normal cum readings plus 6 & 7. |

## Tests with three input files of readings

The input neter file will be pipe#AInput.csv, pipe#BInput.csv & pipe#CInput.csv and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected.

| number | manual test ID | Descending time | Cumulative | Cumulative reset | Reading length variation | Reading gap | Duplication | End only | Description |
| :----: | :----------:   | :-------------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :------: | :---------: |
| 60     | pipe23         |                 | X          |                  |                          |             |             |          |     Add in cumulative readings via two more uploads of a single value. Expect normal cum readings plus 6 & 7. |

## Tests with two input files of first meter and then readings

The input neter file will be pipe#AInputMeter.csv, the input readings file will be pipe#BInput.csv and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected. The meter values should also be tested.

| number | manual test ID | Descending time | Cumulative | Cumulative reset | Reading length variation | Reading gap | Duplication | End only | Description |
| :----: | :----------:   | :-------------: | :--------: | :--------------: | :----------------------: | :---------: | :---------: | :------: | :---------: |
| 70     | pipe27         |                 | X          |                  |                          |             |             |          |     The meter in DB is set to cumulative, cumulative_reset to true & reset range is 11:45-12:15 but not sent via curl. This and following ones test that you can create a meter with various values set. The reset value should be reject row 4 since negative and no readings for meter. |
| 71     | pipe28         |                 | X          |                  |                          |             |             |          |     The meter in DB is set to cumulative, cumulative_reset to true & reset range is 11:45-12:15 but then sent via curl so should reset around midnight. Should get usual cumulative values. |
| 72     | pipe29         |                 |            |                  |                          |             |             |          |     The meter in DB is set to reading_gap=60 and reading_variation=120. Should get warning for gap for line 4 and Length variation for line 5. Expect 1, 2+, 3, 4+, 5-, 5- (same as previous point and extra one since last reading goes into next day) |
 | 73    | pipe30         |                 |            |                  |                          |             |             |          |     The meter in DB is set to reading_gap=60 and reading_variation=120 but then the curl passes 120.1 and 121.2 for gap & variation. Should get Length variation for line 5. Expect 1, 2+, 3, 4+, 5-, 5- (same as previous point and extra one since last reading goes into next day). This also checks that floating point numbers come through correctly by seeing message has correct value.

## Tests with multiple input files of first two meter and then readings

The two input neter files will be pipe#AInputMeter.csv & pipe#BInputMeter.csv, the input readings file will be pipe#CInput.csv and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected. The meter values should also be tested.

## Tests with two input files of meters that are gzipped meters and then readings

The input meter file will be pipe#AInputMeter.csv.gz & pipe#BInputMeter.csv.gz, the input readings file will be pipe#CInput.csv and the expected output is in pipe#Expected.csv where that output CSV is empty if the readings are rejected. The meter values should also be tested.

Checks creating and updating meter with gzip file and header. Expect usual cumulative values. |

## Tests with one input file of meters

The input file will be pipe#InputMeter.csv. The meter values must be tested.

All updates should be rejected with error. Original meter creation should give meters pipe40 and pipe40b. pipe40 sets note to note40, area to 13, reading to 17, start time to 1111-11-10 11:11:11 and end time to 1111-11-11 11:11:11 to test setting these values since not done before. |
